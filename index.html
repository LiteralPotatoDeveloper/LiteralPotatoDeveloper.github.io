      <h3>Thomas Savine</h3>
      <p> I am primarily a C# developer, developing standalone tools to ease workload of manual tasks and 
      develop modifications for games.
	  I currently know C# to an intermediate level, with a focus on reverse engineering and reflection,
	  along with a working knowledge of Python, LUA and Visual Basic, along with the basic web languages
	  (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).
	  I am currently learning C++(for my own projects) and Java(as part of university)
	  In addition to knowing these languages, I am proficient in reversing programs using tools such as
	  AIDA64 for programs not using .NET and DNSpy/ILSpy for programs using .NET framework, with knowledge on
	  deobfuscation and ILCode modification.
	  
	  I was introduced to programming through LUA in games such as Garrys' Mod and Roblox, which allowed
	  users to script in the game, creating mods and fun additions to the game.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Bitcoin Bubbles</h3>
    <p>

	A recreation of <a href="https://www.bitlisten.com/">BitListen</a> 
	in Processing created in the Programming Bootcamp (2021) of City, University of London.<br>
	
	I tried to incorporate as many skills as I could to demonstrate my programming knowledge
	into this project, however there are many differences between C# and Java that I still need
	to learn.<br>
	These skills include classes, arrays, concurrency, web interactions, data visualization, sounds and more.<br>
	
	To do so, I used a WebSocket library to connect to the <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/api/api_websocket">Blockchain API</a>
	and requested to recieve messages for each unconfirmed transaction and block mined, which provided
	me with additional information such as the values of transactiosn involved, allowing me to
	display the data in the form of bubbles, along with playing sounds varying on the value.<br>
	
	Bubbles and Blocks are stored in an array to keep track and dispose of objects no longer visible and
	logarithmic algorithms are used to determine the speed of the bubble, based on value along with the
	volume and pitch of the sounds (Still experimental).<br>
	
	This project also involved minor modifications to a library in order to ensure compatibility, I
	edited the library to allow for larger text sizes to be recieved by my websocket.<br>
	
	This project has proven to be a nice introduction to data visualization and web communication along
	with helping me learn Java.<br>
	
	There are also many improvements that can be made, including bubble collision, optimization and 
	even potential to become a game to click bubbles to collect bitcoin or view the transaction which
	can be implemented when I learn more Java<br>

    <h3>Abyssal Tower</h3>
    <p>
	
	A game created for my 2022 Java Project in City, University Of London.<br><br>
	
	A quick summary of the game would be that it's a roguelike platformer with random levels.<br>
	The game currently consists of 3 random levels, which are picked at the end of each level, allowing the gameplay to go on infinitely.<br><br>
	
	The game features a functioning menu system, complete with functioning volume sliders by using the observer pattern to notify listeners.<br>
	There is also a pause menu ingame, allowing players to pause and save to continue at a different date.<br><br>
	
	The main challenge I had while creating this game was learning about java components that I needed, such as thread-safe javax swing timers, and constructing the gui.<br><br>
	Additionally, the implementation of animation was hard due to the lack of a BodyImage constructor which could take a raw image.<br><br>
	This would of allowed for more efficient usage of sprites, by internally splitting them
	
	This game could be improved by furthering my knowledge of OOP languages, allowing me to implement features
	more efficiently.<br>
